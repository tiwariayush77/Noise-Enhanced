## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep violet (#703AD6), inspired by intelligence and serenity, complements the app's purpose of insightful health data analysis.
- Background color: Dark grey (#121212), provides a sophisticated backdrop that highlights the primary color, and minimizes eye strain.
- Accent color: Teal (#33BBC5), to ensure affordance by standing out from the deep violet in buttons, icons and controls.
- Font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font, used for headings and body text alike due to its clean, readable design, fitting the modern look of the app. Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Use consistent, minimalist icons throughout the app to represent different health metrics, actions, and categories.
- Employ a clean, card-based layout with ample spacing and rounded corners to enhance readability and user experience.
- Incorporate subtle animations and transitions to provide feedback and enhance the overall app experience, such as progress animations and smooth transitions between screens.
